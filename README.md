## Objectives

The primary functionality of Contractr is to provide a platform where freelancers and employers can easily connect, communicate, and finalize job arrangements. The application will utilize location-based services and an intuitive matching algorithm to facilitate job postings and applications. A secure ledger will maintain a comprehensive history of all transactions and interactions between users.

## Business Objectives

The project aims to minimize hiring costs and optimize the job-finding process for both freelancers and employers, offering an effective means for specialists to showcase their skills while providing employers with a diverse talent pool and simplify the research process of finding the highest quality professionals for a job.

## Current Business Process and Rules

Currently, freelancers face challenges in finding suitable job opportunities that match their skills, while employers struggle to locate qualified candidates. Traditional job boards can be cumbersome and inefficient, often leading to mismatched expectations. Contractr aims to bridge this gap by providing a dynamic platform that allows for easy job listings, application reviews, and direct communication between parties.
